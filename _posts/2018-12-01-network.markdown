Linked Pasts Network refers to a growing collection of historical datasets published as Linked Open Data and the community of researchers across the globe whose projects are producing and using them. The nature of this emerging network is discussed at the Linked Pasts series of international symposia. [Linked Pasts IV](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/linked-pasts-iv-views-from-inside-the-lod-cloud-tickets-47761266233) was held in Mainz, Germany from 11-14 December 2018.

This site and [repo]({{ 'https://github.com/linkedpasts' | absolute_url}}){:target="_blank"} are just getting under way. This visualization is a partial view of the projects and supporting organizations within the "geospatial region" of the network. Further information about Linked Pasts can be found in a Dec 2017 white paper, ["From Linking Places to a Linked Pasts Network"]({{ "/assets/lp_whitepaper.pdf" | absolute_url }}){:target="_blank"}
